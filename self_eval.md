# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
<br> getting started with the .each statements.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
<br> Having a notebook handy to write down the way things should look is very handy and I have since started compiling even more info into it.I take notes on concepts and syntax that confuses me so I have the answers if i struggle again.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
<br> at first googling, but not I try to work through it first on my own.
